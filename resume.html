            During my first year in drama
            club, I helped manage the sound
            for two shows. As the sound tech,
            I made sure everyone had their
            microphones on when they had to
            be and I adjusted the volume on
            their microphones.
            And during my second year I was
            an actor in our last production of
            the 2024 school year where I
            played a semi-lead role.

            While taking Web Application
            Design at the Center for
            Advanced Research and
            Technology I helped in
            creating a website dedicated to
            Jurassic Park. For the website I
            mainly did HTML and the
            prototypes. We made the
            prototypes using the design
            app called Figma

        <p>I am great at communicating and
            getting people to communicate
            with each other. I enjoy being
            around people and I am willing to
            learn any skills I may need in the
            future. I try my best to
            understand the task at hand and
            ask questions when needed. I also
            love art and enjoy doing creative
            things like painting, drawing,
            designing, music making, and
            acting.
