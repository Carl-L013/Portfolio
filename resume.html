            Experience:
            <br>
            Worked in Fresno High school's Drama Club
            <br>
            February 2022 - June 2024
            <br>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>During my first year in drama
                club, I helped manage the sound
                for two shows. As the sound tech,
                I made sure everyone had their
                microphones on when they had to
                be and I adjusted the volume on
                their microphones.
                And during my second year I was
                an actor in our last production of
                the 2024 school year where I
                played a semi-lead role.

            Created websites and prototypes
            <br>
            October 2023 - June 2024
            <br>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                While taking Web Application
                Design at the Center for
                Advanced Research and
                Technology I helped in
                creating a website dedicated to
                Jurassic Park. For the website I
                mainly did HTML and the
                prototypes. We made the
                prototypes using the design
                app called Figma

            ABOUT ME
        </p>
        <p>I am great at communicating and
            getting people to communicate
            with each other. I enjoy being
            around people and I am willing to
            learn any skills I may need in the
            future. I try my best to
            understand the task at hand and
            ask questions when needed. I also
            love art and enjoy doing creative
            things like painting, drawing,
            designing, music making, and
            acting.
