            I made this using Photopea while in class one day. I was going to continue editing it, however I realized it
            looks good just the way it is now.

            I also made this in Photopea while in class originally with the purpose of it being a meme but I've used it
            as profile photos before.

            Once again made in Photopea with the purpose of just being funny. This image in particular was a pain to
            resize for this portfolio.

            I made this banner in Canva for my Linkedin profile. It highlights my creativity, love for theater, and my
            chaotic energy I bring.

            This is the main character for the game I made called Tavernventures. They look a lot like a vampire but
            that's mainly because we couldn't figure out what skin tone they should have so now they look like the
            gender-bent version of Marceline from Adventure Time.

            This is the Tavernkeep from Tavernventures. He's old and has seen some things.

            This is Solar, he's based off the DnD version of Solar becasue that's what Tavernventures Is based off of. He's very yellow and I gave him the K-pop haircut.

           The Lich doesn't have hands. This is because I can't do pixelated hands very well. He looks like he's dancing and I love that for him.
